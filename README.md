Le Bellisimo channel is ala AgentJayZ
- vids  = https://www.youtube.com/user/AgentJayZ

## So the mad idea

This is on github, and a mad idea
- idea is to create an index
- and a mix of the vids
- and meta data
- so i can view the vids..

Problems:
- impossible to mark all the vids+voids.
-  we use the "fan base", pun intended
- and let users tag videos and mark start end timee etc..

eg if I am interested in "nozzles"
- i can click the tag labelled nozzle, and find all nozzles..
- but only if its tagged..

The fun will be the "filter"
